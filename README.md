This todo app has been created using pure vanilla javascript without using any library or any framework.

At the first I created a simple html page and styled it using css.

Then I created the javascript code containing different functions like renderList, adding task, deleting task, toggling task etc.
I created a li element using document.createElement function and passed the task list data to it coming from event listeners and event target.

I also added an extra feature of DARK MODE. 
Toggling it using the switch button will throw the page into dark mode and vice versa. 
I have imported the switch button from bootstrap.

I have also created another todo list (not uploading that) using APIs in which task list data was fetched from a dummy list through fetch function and displayed.
